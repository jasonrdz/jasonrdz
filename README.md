- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jasonrdz
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning more coding techniques while also other methods to assist me in my data analysis, but learning more about machine learning and backend develop is where the majority of my interest resides. 
- ðŸŒ±I am currently working with Tableau and Python at my current internship, while self-teaching myself Java to become a data engineer one day while staying on my data scientist pathway. 
- ðŸ“« You can reach me at jjasonrdz@gmail.com
- Much of my current work is private, given a lot of it is school work, but I use GitHub primarily to search for new projects and code to look at and analyze!
